# ML Paper Visualizer - Technology Selection

## 1. Frontend Technologies

### 1.1 Framework: Next.js
- **Rationale**: Next.js provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes in a single framework
- **Benefits**: Improved SEO, faster page loads, simplified routing, built-in API capabilities
- **Alternatives Considered**: React (lacks SSR), Vue.js (smaller ecosystem), Angular (steeper learning curve)

### 1.2 Language: TypeScript
- **Rationale**: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and developer experience
- **Benefits**: Better IDE support, fewer runtime errors, improved maintainability
- **Alternatives Considered**: JavaScript (lacks type safety)

### 1.3 Styling: Tailwind CSS
- **Rationale**: Tailwind provides utility-first CSS that speeds up UI development
- **Benefits**: Consistent design system, reduced CSS complexity, responsive design utilities
- **Alternatives Considered**: CSS Modules (more verbose), Styled Components (higher runtime cost)

### 1.4 Visualization Library: D3.js
- **Rationale**: D3.js is the most powerful and flexible data visualization library
- **Benefits**: Complete control over visualizations, extensive documentation, large community
- **Alternatives Considered**: Mermaid.js (simpler but less flexible), Vis.js (easier but less customizable)

### 1.5 State Management: React Context + Hooks
- **Rationale**: For our app's complexity level, React's built-in state management is sufficient
- **Benefits**: Simpler implementation, no additional dependencies, native to React
- **Alternatives Considered**: Redux (overkill for our needs), Zustand (unnecessary abstraction)

## 2. Backend Technologies

### 2.1 Framework: FastAPI
- **Rationale**: FastAPI is a modern, fast Python web framework ideal for building APIs
- **Benefits**: Automatic OpenAPI documentation, type validation, async support, high performance
- **Alternatives Considered**: Flask (slower, less modern), Django (too heavyweight for our API needs)

### 2.2 Language: Python 3.10+
- **Rationale**: Python is ideal for data processing and ML-related tasks
- **Benefits**: Rich ecosystem for scientific computing, easy integration with ML libraries
- **Alternatives Considered**: Node.js (weaker ML/scientific libraries)

### 2.3 PDF Processing: PyMuPDF
- **Rationale**: PyMuPDF (fitz) offers comprehensive PDF parsing capabilities
- **Benefits**: Fast performance, text extraction with layout preservation, image extraction
- **Alternatives Considered**: PDFMiner (slower), PyPDF2 (fewer features)

### 2.4 NLP Processing: Hugging Face Transformers
- **Rationale**: Transformers provides state-of-the-art NLP models for text analysis
- **Benefits**: Pre-trained models, easy fine-tuning, active development
- **Alternatives Considered**: spaCy (less powerful for scientific text), NLTK (more basic capabilities)

## 3. AI Services

### 3.1 LLM Integration: OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- **Rationale**: GPT-4 provides state-of-the-art text understanding and generation capabilities
- **Benefits**: Excellent understanding of scientific text, strong reasoning capabilities
- **Alternatives Considered**: Claude (comparable but different strengths), Llama 2 (requires self-hosting)

### 3.2 Prompt Engineering: Custom Templates
- **Rationale**: Similar to GitDiagram's approach, custom prompt templates will guide the AI
- **Benefits**: Consistent extraction results, optimized for ML paper structure
- **Alternatives Considered**: Fine-tuned models (higher cost, more complex)

## 4. Infrastructure

### 4.1 Containerization: Docker
- **Rationale**: Docker provides consistent environments across development and production
- **Benefits**: Simplified deployment, environment consistency, isolation
- **Alternatives Considered**: Direct deployment (less portable), virtual machines (heavier)

### 4.2 Frontend Hosting: Vercel
- **Rationale**: Vercel is optimized for Next.js applications
- **Benefits**: Easy deployment, global CDN, serverless functions
- **Alternatives Considered**: Netlify (less Next.js optimized), AWS Amplify (more complex)

### 4.3 Backend Hosting: Cloud Run or AWS Lambda
- **Rationale**: Serverless deployment simplifies scaling and reduces costs
- **Benefits**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use pricing, managed infrastructure
- **Alternatives Considered**: Traditional VPS (requires more management), Kubernetes (overkill)

### 4.4 Database: PostgreSQL
- **Rationale**: PostgreSQL offers robust relational database capabilities with JSON support
- **Benefits**: ACID compliance, JSON/JSONB for flexible schema, strong ecosystem
- **Alternatives Considered**: MongoDB (less structured), SQLite (not suitable for production)

## 5. Development Tools

### 5.1 Version Control: Git + GitHub
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for version control and collaboration
- **Benefits**: Pull requests, issue tracking, CI/CD integration
- **Alternatives Considered**: GitLab (fewer integrations), Bitbucket (smaller community)

### 5.2 CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- **Rationale**: Tight integration with GitHub repository
- **Benefits**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Alternatives Considered**: CircleCI (requires additional setup), Jenkins (too complex)

### 5.3 Code Quality: ESLint, Prettier, mypy
- **Rationale**: Automated tools ensure code quality and consistency
- **Benefits**: Consistent code style, early error detection
- **Alternatives Considered**: Manual code reviews only (less consistent)

## 6. Justification for Technology Choices

The selected technology stack balances several key considerations:

1. **Modern Development Practices**: Next.js, TypeScript, and FastAPI represent modern, type-safe approaches to web development.

2. **ML/AI Integration**: Python backend with Hugging Face and OpenAI integration provides strong capabilities for ML paper analysis.

3. **Visualization Power**: D3.js offers the flexibility needed for complex ML workflow visualizations.

4. **Developer Experience**: Tools like Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and GitHub Actions improve development efficiency.

5. **Scalability**: Docker, serverless hosting, and PostgreSQL provide a foundation that can scale with user demand.

6. **Maintainability**: TypeScript, modular architecture, and automated testing support long-term maintenance.

This technology stack closely mirrors successful approaches seen in GitDiagram while adapting specifically for ML paper visualization needs.
